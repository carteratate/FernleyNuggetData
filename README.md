## SHAP Analysis

The `shap_analysis.py` script computes SHAP feature importances for the
`RandomForestRegressor` used in this project. It loads the same dataset
created in `feat_create.py` and read in `rf_training.py`.

Data loading in the training script occurs at lines 8-11:

```python
df = pd.read_csv("Data/features.csv")
y = df["coinin"]
X = df.drop(columns=["coinin"])
```

These features are generated by `feat_create.py` at lines 146-157 before
being saved to `Data/features.csv`.

Spatial-related columns such as `x`, `y`, `near_main_door`, and the
`is_cluster*` indicators are engineered around lines 64-88 in
`feat_create.py`. The SHAP analysis script highlights these fields
separately so you can gauge how a machine's location affects the model.

To run the SHAP analysis and open the summary plot, execute:

```bash
python shap_analysis.py
```
